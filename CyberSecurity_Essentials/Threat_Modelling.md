# Threat Modelling 
`Identifying what threats an organisation, a target network, or an in-scope application should be worried about`
* For pen testing:
    - Modeling (mapping out)
    - The treats (the things that can attack/harm)
    - To inform the types of activities conducted
    - And to inform the risk of the discovered vulnerabilities
    
* After Pen test:
    - Applying countermeasures and mitigating controls to address dangers
    
            Where am I most vulnerable?
            what are the most relevenaat threats?
            what do i need to do to safegaurd against these threats?

## PASTA
