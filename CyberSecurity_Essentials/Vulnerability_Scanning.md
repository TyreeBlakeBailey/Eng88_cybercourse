# Vulnerability Scanning

`Vulnerability scanning is the act of identifying potential vulnerabilities in network devices such as firewalls, router, switches, severs and applications `

- A vulnerability scanner:
    - Scans a specified set of ports on a remote host
    - Tries to test the services on each port
    - Automated
    - Requires automated tools to manage a high number of asserts 
    

## Data-Source (where to find vulnerabilities)
`CVE (Common vulnerabilities and exposures ) `
- CVE sources:
    - https://cve.mitre.org
    - https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist
    - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search
    - https://www.cvedetails.com/

## Vulnerabilities Categories
- Outdated software
    - i.e firmware for your router
- Misconfigured Software
    - i.e leaving a webserver configuration as default
- Poorly developed applications
    - Website attacks
    - Mobile application attacks

- Cloud Application
- Data Breaches 
- Vulnerabilities in shares of the form `\\server\share over the SMB protocol`

## Scanner Types
- Network Vulnerability scanners
- Wireless Scanner 
- Agent-Based Scanner
    - Internally installed scanner on your server that scans automatically and sends information but to admin
- Web application scanner
    - Used to crawl all the URLs and checks each one for vulnerabilities 
- Database scanners

## Scanning scheduling strategy
- Change based
    - Whenever the company changes anything in the infrastructure run a vuln test 
- Hygiene Based
- Compliance Based
    - Trying to be compliant with a protocol such as GDPR or depending on your service
